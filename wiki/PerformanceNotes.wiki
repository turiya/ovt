#summary Notes on performance and possible improvements

Notes from issue 16:

First test results:
{{{
4.376273s render 100k points
4.792301s render 100k points in frame
1.156071s render 100k path
3.396213s render 100k path in frame
}}}

I'm puzzled that frame rendering slows paths much more than points. My first guess
was that transformations have something to do with it. If I change
transform_scene_node to return the node without transforming it, the path falls back
in line:
{{{
4.096256s render 100k points
4.320270s render 100k points in frame
1.132072s render 100k path
1.192074s render 100k path in frame
}}}

Nulling out cairo drawing for paths drops the time to near zero:
{{{
0.000000s render 100k path
0.064004s render 100k path in frame
}}}

Without making cairo faster, it looks like all I can do for paths is improve
transformation time.

Disabling antialiasing makes paths about .3s faster.

Cutting out cairo drawing for points drops the time significantly:
{{{
0.224014s render 100k points
0.432027s render 100k points in frame
}}}
