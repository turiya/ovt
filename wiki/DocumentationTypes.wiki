#summary styles and methods of documenting ovt for users
#labels Phase-Design

=ocamldoc=

Basic api reference. Is it possible to separate documentation for users from that for developers?


=Visual Tests=

Code snippets which exercise a small bit of functionality. Requires the greater visual test framework to function. Output stored for testing and reference. Example: label placement on axes.

It might be nice to expose some of the visual tests as feature documentation and examples. The documentation for axis label placement might link to the relevant visual test. 

This strikes me as cool, but is it useful? Very few ovt features go beyond the self-explanatory.


=Examples=

Self-contained programs meant to give the user a starting point for writing their own visualizations. 


=Developer/Design Docs=

Mostly kept on the wiki. Explains the internal structure of ovt and justifies design decisions.
